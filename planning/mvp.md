# Minimum Viable Product (`libasv`)

The `libasv` MVP would be capable of the following, via a simple command-line wrapper:

* Loading a vehicle definition and parsing it into vehicle components in memory.
* The vehicle definition would define a single root vehicle component that contains a solid fuel motor.
* The vehicle component would be placed on Earth, at a user-specified position in user-specified conditions.
* The simulation would be run. The results would be logged to a file.
